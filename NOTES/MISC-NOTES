Some extra notes about uses of Tie::File.

Suppose you want to sort a file.  Doing this will work:

        @LINES = sort @LINES;

but it has the drawback that it reads the entire file into memory,
sorts it, and writes back the sorted data.  

A possible alternative would be to code a sort manually:

        sub qsort (\@) {
          my ($aref, $lo, $hi) = @_;
          unless defined ($lo) {
            $lo = 0;  $hi = $#$aref;
          }
          return if $hi < $lo + 1;

          
        }
